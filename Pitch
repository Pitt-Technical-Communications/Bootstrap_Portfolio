Our group is proposing the creation of a Computer Science bootstrap portfolio. The purpose of our project is to increase the marketability of Computer Scientists. We will achieve this goal by creating a bootstrap that is globally attractive, structurally sound, and especially eye-catching to potential employers. We undoubtedly believe that our field specific portfolio will better showcase the appealing attributes that employers look for.
